# STATS220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

1. I am a Stage II student majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.
2. I am taking STATS 220 to learn how to better use data technologies and programming languages for data processing, while also deepening my understanding of statistics and data.
3. I hope everything goes well in this course!
4. I like watching ASMR and this is my favorite youtuber [nara](https://www.youtube.com/@nara.asmr.).
